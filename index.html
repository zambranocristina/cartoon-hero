          <h2>Abour Mario</h2>
          <p>Mario is awesome! Mario is depicted as a portly plumber who lives
            in the fictional land of the Mushroom Kingdom with Luigi, his
            younger, taller brother. In the television series and film,
            Mario and Luigi are originally from Brooklyn, New York.</p>
